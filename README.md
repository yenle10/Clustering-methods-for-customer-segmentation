Goal of the project: We use machine learning clustering algorithms to analyze the spending behavior of credit card users. By applying algorithms we segment customers based on transaction patterns, purchase frequency, cash advances, credit usage..

Outline

i. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Missing value, Outliers handle
Correlation matrix

ii. Clustering methods
Dimension reduction: PCA and Plot of Cumulative Variance Explained by Principal components
Hierarchical clustering (Dendogram), Kmeans (Elbow, Silhouette Method)
DBSCAN, Spectral clustering
Gaussian Mixture Model with four covariance types and BIC, AIC score
